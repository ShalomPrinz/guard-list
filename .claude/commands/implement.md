1. **Implement**
Read the prompt file passed as argument. If it contains a "Depends on" section, verify those dependencies are already implemented — if not, inform the user and ask whether to implement them now or stop and handle them manually. Then implement everything described in the prompt file.

2. **Verify**
Review the User Raw Description and the modified files to execute a combined verification: trace the UI "happy path", test related edge cases, and check for regression risks from docs/ERRORS.md; then, list every specific user requirement from the prompt, marking each as ✅ or ❌, and do not declare the task complete until all ❌ items are fixed and any missing tests are written.

3. **Update Documents**
Run `/update-docs`. Scope is limited to what was just implemented — do not review the entire conversation history.

Tell the user (in your response, not in any file) shortly about any instructions or requirements you decided to defer or ignore.
